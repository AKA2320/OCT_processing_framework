# OCT Processing Framework

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for performing processing of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes. The framework focuses on providing both a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) and command-line tools for batch processing. It aims to correct for distortions and motion artifacts in OCT images, improving their quality and enabling more accurate analysis through advanced image processing techniques, deep learning models, and optimization algorithms.

Standalone applications for macOS and Windows are also available for download from our GitHub releases, providing a convenient way to use the framework without installing Python or other dependencies.

## Key Features

*   **Feature Detection:** Employs state-of-the-art YOLO models for detecting anatomical features and structures in OCT images
*   **Multi-dimensional Motion Correction:** Corrects for motion artifacts in X, Y, and Z (flattening) directions
*   **Deep Learning Integration:** Utilizes Swin Transformer-based "TransMorph" models for advanced registration tasks
*   **Flexible Configuration:** GUI allows real-time configuration of processing parameters; command-line interface uses YAML configuration files
*   **Dual Interface:** Provides both GUI (PySide6) and command-line interfaces for different use cases
*   **Multi-format Support:** Supports `.h5` and `.dcm` OCT data formats
*   **Batch Processing:** GUI supports batch processing of multiple volumes; command-line interface includes SLURM multiprocessing capabilities for handling large datasets efficiently
*   **Standalone Applications:** Pre-built macOS and Windows applications available for easy deployment without Python installation

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** This project requires Python 3.12. Please ensure you have Python 3.12 installed before proceeding.

### Quick Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/AKA2320/OCT_registration_framework.git
    cd OCT_registration_framework
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```shell
    python3.12 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the package:**
    
    **Option A: Using pip (standard)**
    ```shell
    pip install .
    ```
    
    **Option B: Using uv (faster, recommended)**
    ```shell
    pip install uv
    uv pip install .
    ```
    * Before using `uv`, ensure that it is installed. Refer to the official [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for installation instructions.

    **Option C: Using uv with lock file (most reproducible)**
    ```shell
    uv sync
    ```

4. **Install optional dependencies (multiprocessing support) (SLURM based multiprocessing):**
    ```shell
    pip install ".[multiproc]"  # Using pip
    # or
    uv pip install ".[multiproc]"  # Using uv (faster)
    ```

## Usage

The framework can be used through multiple interfaces depending on your needs:

### Using the GUI (Recommended for Interactive Use)

The GUI provides a user-friendly interface with three main tabs for different workflows:

#### 1. Load & Visualize Tab
- Load OCT data from `.h5` or `.dcm` files
- Visualize data using the integrated Napari viewer
- Supports both single volume and directory-based loading

#### 2. Register Data Tab
- Register individual OCT volumes
- Configure processing parameters in real-time:
  - Expected Cells: Number of cell layers to detect (default: 2)
  - Expected Surfaces: Number of surfaces to detect (default: 2)
  - Use ML Model for Lateral(X) Motion Correction: Enable/disable X-axis motion correction using TransMorph model (if disabled it will use traditional registration)
  - Save Feature Detections: Save annotated images of the detected features
- Cancel long-running registration processes using the Cancel button

#### 3. Batch Register Data Tab
- Process multiple OCT volumes in batch mode
- Same configurable parameters as single registration
- Process entire directories of `.h5` files

To use the GUI:

1.  **Prepare your OCT data:**
    *   Ensure your `.h5` or `.dcm` files are organized in accessible directories

2.  **Launch the GUI:**
    ```shell
    python pyside_gui.py
    ```

3.  **Configure through the interface:**
    *   Select input data directory
    *   Specify output save directory
    *   Adjust processing parameters as needed
    *   Monitor progress through the built-in output log

### Using Command-Line Scripts

#### Standard Registration Script
The command-line interface provides access to advanced features including SLURM-based multiprocessing, which is not available in the GUI.

1. **Configure datapaths.yaml:**
   Edit `datapaths.yaml` to specify:
   - Input data directory (`DATA_LOAD_DIR`): Path to the parent directory containing scan folders (e.g., `/path/to/data_folder`).
   - Output save directory (`DATA_SAVE_DIR`): Path where registered data will be saved (e.g., `/path/to/output_folder`).
   - Model paths for feature detection and translation.
   - Processing parameters (`USE_MODEL_LATERAL_TRANSLATION`, `EXPECTED_SURFACES`, `EXPECTED_CELLS`, `SAVE_DETECTIONS`).
   - Multiprocessing options (`ENABLE_MULTIPROC_SLURM`).

   **Example Directory Structure for Batch Processing:**
   
   ```
   data_folder/
   ├── scan_001/
   │   └── scan_001.h5
   ├── scan_002/
   │   └── scan_002.h5
   └── scan_003/
       └── scan_003.h5
   ```
   
   - Each scan folder (`scan_001`, `scan_002`, etc.) should contain a single `.h5` or `.dcm` files.

2. **Run the registration:**
   ```shell
   python registration_script.py
   ```

**Note:** SLURM multiprocessing capabilities are only available through the command-line interface and require additional dependencies. Install them with:
```shell
pip install ".[multiproc]"  # Using pip
# or
uv pip install ".[multiproc]"  # Using uv (faster)
```

### Download

Standalone applications are available for download from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AKA2320/OCT_registration_framework/releases) page. Look for the latest release and download the appropriate file for your operating system:

- **macOS**: Download `OCT_mac_app.zip` and unzip the file. The application can be run directly by double-clicking `OCT_mac_app.app`.
- **Windows**: Download `OCT_windows_app.zip` and unzip the file. The application can be run directly by double-clicking `OCT_windows_app.exe`.

### Usage
